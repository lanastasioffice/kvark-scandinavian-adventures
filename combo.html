          <h4> CRUISING THROUGH MAJESTIC FJORDS OF NORWAY
          </h4>
        </div>
        <p>Get your cameras ready for picture postcard moments! There are more than one thousand fjords in Norway. We will visit some of the more famous as we sail along the west coast including Lysefjorden, Sognefjorden, Hardangerfjord,
          Geiranger and Magdalenefjord.</p>
        <p>While fjords resemble calm blue lakes, they consist of saltwater. They were created many years ago as the seas retreated, leaving magnificent cliffs reaching to the skies on both sides.</p>
        <p>Often, we can sail from one fjord to another before going back to the sea. The peace and quiet of the still landscapes are interrupted only by seals and porpoises frolicking in the water, soaring eagles in the blue skies and the call of sheep
          and musk ox along the cliffs.</p>
        <p>At times, you can catch sight of massive waterfalls gushing down the vertical mountainsides from glaciers high above. The truly breathtaking scenery impresses along every nautical mile.</p>

        <p>Our guides will take you into Norway's capital to explore its many museums and open spaces.</p>
        <p>The waterside Norwegian Maritime Museum and the Viking Ship Museum with Viking ships from the 9th century are not to be missed! Folkemuseum has open-air exhibits of daily life and architecture from the 16th century. In the Aker Brygge district, you will find restaurants, galleries and shops along the harborfront. A favorite is the outdoor scupture park, the Vigelandsparken, with 20th century works by Gustav Vigeland. And no visit is complete without stopping at the Munch Museum to view the famed Norwegian painter Edvard Munch's works including "The Scream".</p>

        <p>We arrive in Copenhagen 3 days before Christmas; just in time to explore the Christmas markets and sample some Danish sweets.
        </p>
        <p>In Denmark's capital, we can explore the grounds and gardens of three castles. Amalienborg Palace, the home to the royal family, is located in Frederiksstaden, an 18th century rococo district. Amalienborg has four identical classical palace façades with rococo interiors around an octagonal courtyard. Tours are available and we time our visit to coincide with marches and displays by the royal guards.  Nearby is the Christiansborg Palace and the Renaissance-ara Rosenborg Castle which is home to the crown jewels. A stroll along the waterfront Langelinie brings us to the iconic landmark of "The Little Mermaid"; Evard Eriksen's bronze sculpture of the character from Hans Christian Andersen's fairytale.</p>
      <p>If you are looking for unique Christmas gifts and souvenir's, there will be ample free time to explore Strøget, the pedestrian, car free shopping area in Copenhagen. Located in the center of town, Strøget is one of the longest pedestrian shopping streets in Europe.</p>

          <h4>OUR JOURNEY CONCLUDES IN STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN </h4>
        </div>
        <p>We arrive in Stockholm on the morning of our fifteenth day, Christmas eve. You will still call the Viking Explorer home for two more nights while you explore Sweden's capital during the day. Tell the children not to worry, Santa always makes sure to visit us (we leave out the best cookies and milk).</p>
        <p>Stockholm truly lights up at Christmas time. The city and gardens are adorned with twinkling white lights. Christmas decorations abound and you are sure to get into the holiday spirit.</p>
      <p>A visit to Gamla Stan, The Old Town, with its cobblestone streets and ochre-colored buildings is a highlight. It is one of the largest and best preserved medieval city centers in Europe. Stockholm was founded here in 1252. Gamla Stan's Christmas market is the most famous and traditional in Stockholm. It is found at Stortorget square, close to the Royal Palace. The small red stalls offer a large selection of Swedish handicrafts, decorative arts, Swedish Christmas sweets, smoked sausages, glögg and other Christmas delicacies.</p>
      <p>Stockholm's churches welcome everyone at Christmas. Storkyrkan (Stockholm Cathedral) is the city's oldest church from about 1250 is located in Gamla Stan. It is dedicated to St. Nicolaus. Also in Gamla Stan is Tyska Kyrkan (The German Church) which dates back to the late 1500s. Its beautiful spire was erected 140 years ago after a fire destroyed the original tower. </p>
